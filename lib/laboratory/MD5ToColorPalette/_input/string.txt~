It was a cold
morning, in hotel suite.
In room 309, it was nine.
And nobody could find his body.

It was one of those room,
that nobody took a broom.
The hours ticked on by
and nobody ever seems to leave.

With only some entering,
and nobody leaving,
Its a test of patience, and rent,
To see how all the time was spent.

Time looms around, like an unseen ghost,
With dimensions spirits go in and out.

There was one renter,v
That booked a stay in this fated room.
Everything seemed to go as normal,
then he met his doom.

Time looms around, like an unseen ghost,
With dimensions spirits go in and out.

When he entered the room,
That night all the lights dimmed out,
And he could here footsteps in the kitchen,
But the door stayed locked.

Buttons down never seem to work,
With the only new person,
An online mailer, sending skate shoes.
Nobody could here the tenants screams,
As he sang his final blue.

Time looms around, like an unseen ghost,
With dimensions spirits go in and out.

It was the last tenant to entering,
the last to leave, that man named Steve.
Entering the suit without an exit.
And never a moment to leave.

The hotel with no exit door.
