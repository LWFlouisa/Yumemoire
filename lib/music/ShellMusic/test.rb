system("espeak -p 95 -a 25 'Someday I will see you again, I will,
Climb the mountains longing for it,
I will have your embrace even as I climb so far to see the world,
I will climb so far,
I climb the world, as it is my will,

The rose in hair,
Hair; the flowing, flowing,
Dress, eyes forlorn.

Across the sand and rivers,
Across the sand and rivers,
The long black hair,

Flowing; her eyes forlorn,
For the old raven,
That said nevermore,
Rose in hair.

Between hills and forests,
Under blown leaf,
The wolf hunts a black sheep,

Under blown leaf,
Between hills and forests,
The shadows glare,
Beneath the damp leaf,

Mignon girl running,
To catch a deer blitzing,
The daffodil flops,
As the day comes closing,

As the day comes closing,
The moonlight is,
Hovering; cloudy sky,
Pouring with the,
Rain falling from the sky,

Only tears end this day,
The wolf now is so hungry,
For the dark brown dress,
The wolf now is so hungry,
For a long caress,

The wolf now is so hungry,
For the blood on dress,
From Daffodils blood.

Slowly the mind eats itself,
Even as the thoughts melt away,
Low key night terrors,

Follow along the way,
Deny the pain, deny the dullness,
Of the doubt there to stay,
Unless one prefers no company,
Besides the shadows on the wall,
There to stay,

All the old women
Carrying the hunger pains.
All the old men
Working the night shift.
Carrying the hunger pains,
We want liberty.

Carrying the hunger pains,
Working the night shift.
Along the bright city lights.
Along the bright city lights.

How proud we be
To be of the shining knights,
With pitchforks and sledge.
Arise, fatherlands children,
May your rein last 1000 years.

Arise, fatherlands children,
Become like boulders,
Grow into a battalion.
Arm our citizens.

The blades so sharp
And true to a point.
Uniforms so sleak.

The nighthawk reins highlands.
The nighthawk reins highlands.

From the sky it drops
To eat fallen depris.
From the sky it drops
All the dust from the dark sky.

All the dust from the dark sky.
Arise, fatherlands children,
May your rein last 1000 years.

Arise, fatherlands children,
Become like boulders,
Grow into a battalion.
Arm our citizens.
During the cold Spring rain,

The drops of blue on grass.
All that is profane
Shall all turn into glass.

Of all the ways to fall down,
The glass shall revert to grass.
In all many pieces
That have returned to glass,
the many pieces,

All that is profane,
Shall all turn into glass.

Of all the ways to fall down,
The glass shall revert to the grass.

I seek the cold water, down river
flowing. For all those lights
In the city nights
  glowing.

To clear thoughts
For all misery
growing.

For me I wither
In your so gentle arms
In your embrace.
I now seek that embrace.
I now seek that embrace.

So small I feel
And yet, embrace
The flow around my neck
And down my spine.
For you my divine.

For you my divine.

To think I am but a Small thing,
yet I trust it
That you love
Under midnight sunset.

Under midnight sunset.'")
